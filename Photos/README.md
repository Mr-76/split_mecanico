Keyboard was made with a a arduino pro micro --- arduino pro micro atmega32u4.
i dont have 2 so i needed to use simple ortholinear layout and then split it..... 
i used 30 diodes in each side, keyboard has 60 keys,
the wires are copper wires i got from some scrap, prob from a angle grinder.
the they keys are blue switchs that i got from a broken wireles mechanical keyboard :)
and the rest of it was made by the 3d printer all yellow parts :()
